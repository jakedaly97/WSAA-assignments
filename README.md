# PFDA Assignments

This project is submitted for the **Programming for Data Analytics** module of the **Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics** course.

## About This Project

This project serves as a practical application of the theoretical knowledge acquired throughout the **Programming for Data Analytics** module. Building upon previously taught material from the **Programming and Scripting** module in semester one, the assignments required a deeper understanding of Python and its various libraries, such as `pandas` and `matplotlib`.

Each task, written in Python, was designed to implement and explore a specific function of the Python language, often requiring research beyond the lecture material. This approach fostered independent thinking and problem-solving skills among the participants.

## Assignments Overview

The project encompasses a total of **4 assignments**, detailed as follows:

### 1. **Assignment 2: Weather Data**  
   - **File**: `assignment2-weather.ipynb`  
   - **Description**: A Jupyter notebook containing a plot of temperature over time.

### 2. **Assignment 3: Pie Chart**  
   - **File**: `assignment03-pie.ipynb`  
   - **Description**: A Jupyter notebook containing a pie chart of email domains. The data was obtained from a CSV file read into pandas.

### 3. **Assignment 5: Risk Simulation**  
   - **File**: `assignment_5_risk.py`  
   - **Description**: A Python program simulating 1000 individual battle rounds in Risk (3 attackers vs 2 defenders). The results were plotted as a bar chart.

### 4. **Assignment 6: Weather Data Analysis**  
   - **File**: `assignment_6_Weather.ipynb`  
   - **Description**: A Jupyter notebook analyzing weather data read into pandas.  
     - The analysis includes calculating the mean temperature for each day.  
     - The notebook contains a total of 7 plots.
