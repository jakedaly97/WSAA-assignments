## About This Project

This project serves as a practical application of the theoretical knowledge acquired throughout the **Web Services and Applications** module. The assignments in this module all focused on interacting with external APIs.


---

## Assignments Overview

The repository contains a total of **3 assignments**, detailed as follows:

### 1. **Assignment 2: Card Draw Simulation**  
   - **File**: `assignment2-carddraw.py`  
   - **Description**: A Python program that interacts with the Deck of Cards API to shuffle a new deck and draw 5 cards. The cards are displayed with their values and suits.

### 2. **Assignment 3: CSO Data Fetcher**  
   - **File**: `assignment03-cso.py`  
   - **Description**: A Python program that fetches data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) API and saves the response as a JSON file for later use.

### 3. **Assignment 4: GitHub File Updater**  
   - **File**: `assignment04-github.py`  
   - **Description**: A Python program using the PyGithub library to authenticate via an API token, fetch a file from a private GitHub repository, and replace occurrences of "Andrew" with "Jake" in the file. The updated file is then committed back to the repository.
